# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective


    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    Interpreting the needs of a user can be done in many ways. The Product Owner could take feedback and invoke responses from users, or user surveys can be         completed privately in order to solicit ideas to implement. User stories can help with this task by providing personalization to certain features. With user stories, we get to see why certain things are important to our users, how to understand their problems and provide solutions. 
    
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    When developing a program, small increments should be developed at a time. The most important features should be developed first and prioritized over non essentials. An agile process I hope to incorporate into my future development work would be to deliver incrementally. The ability to provide functional software quickly is a key factor to a being a successful developer.  
    
    
    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    In software development, being a good team member means to be a great communicator. In an agile Scrum team, communication is more than good listening skills. To    be a great communicator, one must listen, ask questions, participate in Scrum events, and offer help to others when necessary. A good team member is also responsible, self-motivating, and flexible.
